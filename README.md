# BarabasiTeam

I joined the Reply Code Challenge together with my team mates as the **BarabasiTeam** in honour of our hero [Albert-László Barabási](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-László_Barabási) who told the world about Scale Free Networks for the first time, together with [Réka Albert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Réka_Albert).

The code is strictly bounded to the assignment (which you can find in the repository) but doesn't aim to solve anything except the task we've been assigned during the competition.
